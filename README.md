# ClickNGo: Console-Based Merchandise Kiosk System 

**ClickNGo** is a Java-based console application designed to simulate a merchandise kiosk system typically used in concerts and events. It allows users to view products, manage a shopping cart, and checkout orders — all through a text-based interface.

## 💡 Project Overview

ClickNGo aims to provide a simple, interactive shopping experience through the terminal. It is built with object-oriented principles and demonstrates the use of key data structures such as:

- `ArrayList` (for product and cart storage)

- Custom `Queue` (for order processing)

## 🎯 Features

- 🛒 Browse and view available merchandise
- ➕ Add items to the shopping cart
- ✏️ Edit or remove items from the cart
