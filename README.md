# ClickNGo: Console-Based Merchandise Kiosk System

**ClickNGo** is a Java-based console application designed to simulate a merchandise kiosk system typically used in concerts and events. It allows users to view products, manage a shopping cart, and checkout orders — all through a text-based interface.

## 💡 Project Overview

ClickNGo aims to provide a simple, interactive shopping experience through the terminal. It is built with object-oriented principles and demonstrates the use of key data structures such as:

- `ArrayList` (for product and cart storage)
- Custom `Stack` (to track recently viewed items)
- Custom `Queue` (for order processing)

## 🎯 Features

- 🛒 Browse and view available merchandise
- ➕ Add items to the shopping cart
- ✏️ Edit or remove items from the cart
- 📦 View cart summary and checkout
- 🧠 Last viewed items (Stack-based history)
- 🔄 Order queue simulation (Queue for processing orders)

- Object-Oriented Programming
- Console I/O
- Custom-built Stack and Queue structures
